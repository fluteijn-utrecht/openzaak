  and serve uploaded files through the Documenten API.

------------------

Improved support for integration with other APIs, most notably BAG/BRT APIs from the
kadaster (see https://pdok.nl). This increases the usability of ZaakObject relations.

* Added api-test.nl badge - proves that Open Zaak is compliant with the
  *API's voor zaakgericht werken* standard
* Added small documentation improvements
* Updated notification setup instructions
* Added support for API authentication with a simple *API key* (such as BAG or BRT)
* Added support for URL transformation so that data-fetching is forced over NLX
